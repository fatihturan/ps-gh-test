                <h2>7. Free Trial</h2>
                <p>Pine Sports may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription to the Service with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). The duration of the Free Trial and the specific terms will be provided at the time of registration.</p>

                <p>To sign up for a Free Trial, you may be required to enter your billing information. If you do enter your billing information, you will not be charged until the Free Trial period has expired.

                <p>Pine Sports reserves the right to modify or terminate any Free Trial offer at any time, without notice. We may also modify these Terms of Service as they relate to Free Trial offers.</p>

                <p>Restrictions on Free Trial usage include, but are not limited to:</p>

                <h2>8. Purchases, Subscriptions, and Payments</h2>
                <p>Some features of the Service may require payment or a subscription to access. If you wish to purchase a subscription or make any other purchase through the Service (“Purchase”), you may be required to provide certain information relevant to your Purchase, including your payment method, billing address, and other necessary information.</p>

                <p>By providing payment information, you represent and warrant that:</p>

                  <li>The information you provide is accurate, current, and complete.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Subscriptions to the Service are billed on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each Billing Cycle unless canceled prior to the renewal.

                <p>We may use third-party services to facilitate payment processing. By submitting your payment information, you authorize Pine Sports to share your payment information with these third-party services, subject to their privacy policies.</p>

                <p>Pine Sports reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason, including but not limited to product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, or suspected fraud or unauthorized or illegal activity.</p>

                <p>All sales are final, and Pine Sports does not offer refunds except as required by law.</p>

                <h2>9. Fee Changes</h2>
                <p>Pine Sports reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the subscription fees for the Service at any time. Any changes in subscription fees will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

                <p>Pine Sports will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any fee changes to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such changes become effective. If you do not cancel your subscription, your continued use of the Service after the fee change constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.</p>

                <p>If you disagree with the fee change, you may cancel your subscription before the new fee becomes effective.</p>

                <h2>10. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
                <p>You may cancel your subscription to Pine Sports at any time. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Service for the remainder of your current Billing Cycle. After the current Billing Cycle ends, your subscription will not be renewed, and you will no longer be charged.</p>

                <p>To cancel your subscription, you can do so by logging into your account and navigating to the settings & subscription management section, or by contacting Pine Sports customer support.</p>

                <p>Except where required by law, all payments made for subscriptions or other purchases are non-refundable. This includes, but is not limited to, subscriptions that are canceled before the end of the Billing Cycle.</p>

                <p>If Pine Sports finds that you have violated these Terms, we reserve the right to immediately cancel your subscription without refund. Pine Sports is not responsible for any fees or charges incurred by the cancellation of your account.</p>

                <h2>11. Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions</h2>
                <p>Pine Sports may, from time to time, offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) through the Service. These Promotions may be governed by separate rules that are independent of these Terms of Service.</p>

                <p>If you decide to participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules, as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the specific Promotion rules will take precedence for that particular event.</p>

                <p>Pine Sports reserves the right to cancel, modify, or suspend any Promotion at its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>

                <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
